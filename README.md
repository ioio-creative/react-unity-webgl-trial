This project is an attempt to to use the excellent library [react-unity-webgl (RUW)](https://github.com/elraccoone/react-unity-webgl) by [Jeffrey Lanters](https://github.com/jeffreylanters). RUW provides a React component wrapper for embedding a Unity WebGL build in a React application, with two-way communication between the React and Unity applications.

For common usage of RUW, please refer to [RUW's documentation wiki](https://github.com/elraccoone/react-unity-webgl/wiki):
* [Embedding a Unity WebGL build in a React application](https://github.com/elraccoone/react-unity-webgl/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide)
* [Communication from React to Unity](https://github.com/elraccoone/react-unity-webgl/wiki/Communication-from-React-to-Unity)
* [Communication from Unity to React](https://github.com/elraccoone/react-unity-webgl/wiki/Communication-from-Unity-to-React)

To enable two-way React-Unity communication, RUW of course uses methods provided by [Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-interactingwithbrowserscripting.html).

One special note is that when sending messages from Unity to React, one should use the [Pointer_stringify](https://forum.unity.com/threads/pointer_stringify-is-returning-garbled-text.481419/) helper function to convert a Unity C# string (???) to a JavaScript string. This string conversion should be done in JavaScript functions defined in a JSLib file, for [binding communication](https://github.com/elraccoone/react-unity-webgl/wiki/Communication-from-Unity-to-React), to be placed in "Assets/Plugins/WebGL/MyPlugin.jslib" in the Unity project.

This project uses the Unity WebGL builds from the following projects:
* [SpaceShooterTrial](https://github.com/szewa-polyu/SpaceShooterTrial)
* [react-unity-webgl-test](https://github.com/jeffreylanters/react-unity-webgl-test)

The above Unity WebGL builds are placed in the directory "public/unityBuilds" under the CRA directory structure. When specifying buildJsonPath and unityLoaderJsPath for initialising a [UnityContent](https://github.com/elraccoone/react-unity-webgl/blob/master/source/UnityContent.ts) instance, better specify the paths using [process.env.PUBLIC_URL](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-the-public-folder) to ensure that the paths point to CRA's public directory correctly.

Some reflections: I have tried exporting a Unity project to an Android Studio project before. Since I am not too familiar with Android / Gradle development, embedding a Unity project in an Android project was a bit of a pain, due to lots of trial-and-errors when facing build linkage errors. On the other hand, I find embedding a Unity WebGL build in a React application quite easy, thanks to RUW. The web is really a beautiful platform, and React and Unity WebGL can be a match made in heaven:)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App (CRA)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). And the sections below are generated by CRA.

# Create React App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
